Hi this is a repository dedicated to R code with applications in data analysis
This will include
1. Generalized Linear Model
2. Classification Modes such as Logistic Regression, CART, LDA, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Vanila Bagging. 
and more!

The code is may not be truly self-explanatory but I will try to make it as simple and explanatory as possible!

Thanks!
